# Pipelines

The `wmill pipeline` commands inspect and run [pipelines](../../core_concepts/63_pipelines/index.mdx): folders of scripts marked `// pipeline`, wired together by `// on <asset>` annotations. All commands work against the deployed workspace by default; `show`, `run` and `docs` also accept `--local` to work from your working-tree files instead, and `wmill pipeline dev` live-previews local files in the browser (see [local development with --local](#local-development-with---local)).

:::caution Alpha
Pipelines are in alpha; the annotation syntax and behavior are still evolving. See the [Pipelines](../../core_concepts/63_pipelines/index.mdx) page for the full annotation reference.
:::

## Listing pipelines

```bash
wmill pipeline list [--json]
```

Lists the pipeline folders in the workspace. `--json` outputs the list as JSON for piping to `jq`.

## Showing the pipeline graph

```bash
wmill pipeline show <folder> [--json] [--local]
```

Renders the folder's pipeline DAG in the terminal: sources, asset lineage and subscriptions.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | Output the raw asset graph as JSON. |
| `--local` | Build the graph from local working-tree files instead of the deployed workspace. Fully offline, no deploy needed. |

## Running a pipeline

```bash
wmill pipeline run <folder> [options]
```

Runs a cascade: starting from `--from`, every downstream step runs in topological order, stopping at the `--to` end node(s) if given. `--from` may be any runnable node - a schedule/manual root or a mid-DAG model (asset subscriber or pure reader). A mid-DAG start runs that node plus its transitive downstream and never re-runs upstream, matching dbt's `--select model+`. This is the CLI counterpart of the graph's Run + downstream and [selective execution](../../core_concepts/63_pipelines/index.mdx#selective-execution-run-up-to-here).

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--from <script>` | Start script (short name or path). May be any runnable node, including a mid-DAG model - that node and its transitive downstream run, upstream is not re-run (dbt `--select model+`). Defaults to the folder's sole schedule / manual root. |
| `--to <node>` | End node(s) to stop at: script names / paths or asset URIs (e.g. `datatable://main/staged`). Repeatable or comma-separated. Omit to run the full downstream. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the topological run plan without executing it. |
| `--json` | Output the plan as JSON (for piping to `jq`). |
| `--local` | Run the local working-tree scripts via previews (no deploy); the graph is built from local files. |
| `--partition <value>` | Partition value for [`// partitioned`](../../core_concepts/63_pipelines/partitioning.mdx) scripts in the run (e.g. `2026-06-30`); with an explicit value this doubles as a headless [backfill](../../core_concepts/63_pipelines/materialization.mdx#partition-status-and-backfill). With `--local`, time kinds default to the current UTC period when omitted; `dynamic` always needs a value. |
| `--arg <script>:<param>=<value>` | Pass a plain argument to one script in the cascade. The value is parsed as JSON when possible, else taken as a string. Repeatable. |
| `--upload <script>[:<param>]=<source>` | Bind an object to a `data_upload` / `webhook` entry point so it (and its downstream) runs. `<source>` is a local file (uploaded to the workspace store) or an `s3://<storage>/<key>` reference to an existing object (`s3:///<key>` for the default storage). The target S3 object parameter is inferred when the script declares exactly one; otherwise name it with `:<param>`. Repeatable. |

Scripts whose only trigger needs caller input or a per-event payload (`data_upload`, `webhook`, `kafka`, ...) are skipped by default; bind them with `--upload` to include them in the cascade.

### Examples

```bash
# Full cascade from the folder's root
wmill pipeline run ecommerce

# Preview the plan without running anything
wmill pipeline run ecommerce --dry-run

# Bounded slice: run everything needed to produce daily_kpis and stop there
wmill pipeline run ecommerce --to daily_kpis

# Rebuild a mid-DAG model and everything downstream of it (dbt `--select model+`)
wmill pipeline run ecommerce --from fct_orders_daily

# Backfill one day from local working-tree files, without deploying
wmill pipeline run ecommerce --local --partition 2026-06-30

# Feed a data_upload entry point with a local file
wmill pipeline run ecommerce --upload ingest_events=./events.json
```

## Local development with --local

With `--local`, the `show`, `run` and `docs` subcommands build the pipeline from the files in your working tree (for example after a [`wmill sync pull`](./sync.mdx)) using the same WebAssembly parser the frontend uses: asset reads and writes are inferred from the script bodies and the `// pipeline` / `// on` annotations are parsed, so the graph matches what the UI would show after deploying, without deploying anything. This is the pipeline analog of [`wmill dev`](./dev-preview.md) for flows and scripts.

- `show --local` and `docs --local` are fully offline.
- `run --local` executes each script's local content via previews on the remote workspace's workers, in topological order. Data still flows through real [asset](../../core_concepts/52_assets/index.mdx) storage, so the workspace needs its [object storage](../../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx) configured for steps that write S3 or DuckLake assets.
- TypeScript, Python and SQL scripts get full body inference; Go and Bash scripts are detected from their `// pipeline` / `// on` annotations only.

## Live preview with `wmill pipeline dev`

```bash
wmill pipeline dev [folder] [--port <port>] [--no-open] [--frontend <origin>]
```

Watches a folder of `// pipeline` scripts and live-previews the pipeline in the browser: on every save the graph is rebuilt from your working-tree files and pushed over WebSocket to a dev page that renders the same graph view as the pipeline editor, with node selection, run forms, Run and Run + downstream, and live run activity. Editing stays in your own editor (or an agentic loop); adding, editing or renaming a script updates the graph without a reload. Runs launched from the page execute your local file contents via previews, so nothing is deployed.

The folder argument is optional: when run from inside an `f/<folder>` directory, the folder is auto-detected.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--port <port>` | Port for the dev WebSocket server (default `3201`). |
| `--no-open` | Do not open the browser automatically; the URL is printed so the caller (e.g. an AI agent) can hand it to you. |
| `--frontend <origin>` | Origin serving the `/pipeline_dev` page (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` for a locally-run frontend). Defaults to the workspace remote; use it when the remote's deployed frontend predates the dev page. |

## Generating pipeline documentation

```bash
wmill pipeline docs <folder> [--local]
```

Writes a `PIPELINE.md` in the folder describing the pipeline graph and [data table](../../core_concepts/11_persistent_storage/data_tables.mdx) schemas, plus `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` pointers, so a code editor or coding agent gets the same context the UI surfaces. By default it documents the deployed graph; `--local` documents the working tree.
