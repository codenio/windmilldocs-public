# Google Sheets integration

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) is an online spreadsheet application.

The Google Sheets integration is done through OAuth. You just need to sign in from your Google account on your browser. The access will be automatically saved to the workspace as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../advanced/27_setup_oauth/index.mdx).
